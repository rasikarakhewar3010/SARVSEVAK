# SarvSevak – The Culturally Aware Multilingual AI Assistant

> ✨ Empowering global support through **language intelligence** and **cultural empathy**  

---

## 📖 Project Overview

**SarvSevak** is an advanced AI assistant built for global customer service, designed to understand not just what users say, but how they mean it — in their **own language** and **own cultural context**. Our bot bridges the gap between **linguistic translation** and **cultural understanding**, ensuring better customer satisfaction and reduced miscommunication.

Whether it’s a frustrated customer in Tokyo, a confused shopper in Madrid, or a complaint from a user in Mumbai, SarvSevak reacts appropriately — with **real-time sentiment detection**, **tone modulation**, and **cultural awareness**, and it knows when it’s time to escalate the conversation to a human.
